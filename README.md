## About the project

### Why Monekin?

After a lot of research on the marketplaces I could not find any application that met all my needs. That is why I decided to start making my own app. After months of hard work, the first version was released on Google Play in October 2021. I decided to make it 100% Open Source shortly after, with the aim of increasing its user community, and that external developers could help and collaborate with me on the project. Since the day of its release, the app has been continuously improving and updating.

### Tech Stack

Developed in Ionic and Angular, which allows it to be a modern and scalable application to a large number of operating systems and platforms.
